# imgxLab

![Image](/public/imgxlab-hero.png)

An open-source lab for photographers, built by photographers.

Simple, intuitive, and packed with essential tools like metadata analysis, shutter count checks, and format converters. All the essential tools that every photographer needs (at some point).

## Work in Progress.

The idea is to have a long term project that solves simple and common issues that photographers have.

More tools will be added over time.

## Current Tools:

- Metadata Analyzer Tool: Quickly uncover detailed metadata from your unedited images, including camera settings, lens information, copyright data, and more.
- Frame Insets Designer Tool: Enhance your photos with customizable frame insets. Adjust width, aspect ratios, and background colors to match your style.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
